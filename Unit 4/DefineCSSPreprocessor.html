		<dt>What does a CSS preprocessor do?</dt>
			<dd>A CSS preprocessor is used by web developers to process certain languages into css</dd>
		<dt>What are the advantages of using a CSS preprocessor?</dt>
			<dd>A preprocessor can do many various things: checking for syntax errors, use variables to call styles, the ability to call functions from outside sources, and possibly above all else, it can compile all of your styles into one sheet for uploading to the server.</dd>
		<dt>What are the disadvantages or issues you need to consider when using a CSS Preprocessor?</dt>
			<dd>You must change your already established work flow. Because all the sheets are compiles, line numbers are irrelevant for debugging which makes the process harder. You also must wait for the CSS to compile to see changes.</dd>
		<dt>List at least FIVE CSS Preprocessors currently available.</dt>
			<dd>
				<ul>
					<li>SASS</li>
					<li>Stylus</li>
					<li>Less</li>
					<li>CSS-Crush</li>
					<li>Myth</li>
					<li>Clay</li>
					<li>Compass</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
		<dt>Research Web Development jobs and see how many of them list a CSS Preprocessor as one of their desired skills.</dt>
			<dd>I looked through 10-15 job listings and found that none of them listed the ability to use CSS preprocessors as a skill. I think this may mean that it is implied you know how to use it if you're applying for the job(?)</dd>
