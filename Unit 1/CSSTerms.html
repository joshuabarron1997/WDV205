		<dl>
			<dt>Specificity</dt>
				<dd>Specificity is the weight a selector holds on a element. If more than one selector trys to style a element, specificity will determine which style takes precedent. Specificity is used in css to manipulate styles and calculate how heavy certain styles should be so that they do not conflict in the future. </dd>
			<dt>Precedence</dt>
				<dd>Precedence, similar to specificity is a concept that the more specific the style, the more likely it is to be applied over other styles. Precedence is broader and encompasses that inline styles are greater than embeded styles and that embeded styles are greater than external styles. In the event that two styles are equal the style further down on the style sheet applys.</dd>
			<dt>Inheritance</dt>
				<dd>Inheritance is a rule that children elements posses the same styles as their parents. This requires styles be specific lest they change when developers do not want them to.</dd>
			<dt>Property</dt>
				<dd>A property is one third of identifying a style. Property identifies the change that will happen, for example: color, or text-align.</dd>
			<dt>Value</dt>
				<dd>A Value is the amount or way you want to use the Property. For example a value for color could be blue, and for text-align, could be center.</dd>
			<dt>Selector</dt>
				<dd>A selector identifies what you want to apply the property and values on, forming a style. Selectors have their own set of rules and specificites.</dd>
